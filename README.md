# Traveling Salesman Problem

In this project we solved the Traveling Salesman Problem using the Branch and Bound exact algorithm, and Twice-around-the-tree and Christofides heuristic algorithms, comparing their results and execution times.

## How to run

To run the algorithms on the test files, run the following command on the source folder: ```python3 runTSP_tests.py```. The results will be saved in the ```results.csv``` archive.

You can also run the algorithms separately, throgh the tsp.ipybn notebook. In this notebook, you can also evaluate the results of the algorithms on the test files, and compare them to the optimal solution.
